        "# üü¢ Redundancy-Aware Sensor Fusion with Drift Detection (Toy Demo)\n",
        "\n",
        "## üìå What it does\n",
        "- We simulate three sensors measuring the same signal (like room temperature).\n",
        "- After some time, one sensor starts drifting (slowly giving wrong values).\n",
        "- We show how fusion (combining multiple sensors) makes the system more robust.\n",
        "- We also show how to detect the faulty sensor using residuals and agreement checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works\n",
        "- **True signal**: a smooth sine wave representing the real value.\n",
        "- **Sensors**: each = true signal + small random noise.\n",
        "- **Drift**: one sensor gets a slow upward error after a chosen time step.\n",
        "- **Fusion**:\n",
        "  - *Mean fusion* ‚Üí average of the 3 sensors.\n",
        "  - *Weighted fusion* ‚Üí sensors that disagree with the others get lower weight.\n",
        "- **Drift detection**:\n",
        "  - *Residuals* = difference between each sensor and fused value ‚Üí large residuals mean drift.\n",
        "  - *Agreement score* = how much each sensor matches the others ‚Üí a drifting sensor‚Äôs score drops.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üìä What we expect in the results\n",
        "- At first, all sensors agree, and both mean and weighted fusion are accurate.\n",
        "- Once drift starts, the faulty sensor pulls the mean upwards.\n",
        "- Weighted fusion stays closer to the truth because it down-weights the drifter.\n",
        "- Drift detection flags the faulty sensor using residual z-scores and agreement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üåü Why it matters\n",
        "- Redundancy is not wasteful ‚Äî it makes systems more robust.\n",
        "- We can use redundancy to detect faulty or drifting sensors.\n",
        "- This demo is inspired by redundancy-aware systems research.\n"
